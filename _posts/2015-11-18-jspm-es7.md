I just added JSPM compilation in my SailsJS environment so that I could start porting the app to React. Implemented using athlite's recommendation [here][jspm].

Of course, I want to be able to use async/await in my client, I've done this before using straight Bable, but for JSPM I had to do some extra digging. The solution? Simply modify your `config.js` file for JSPM to include `stage: 0` and `es7.decorators` in the `optional` array:
{% highlight json linenos %}
  babelOptions: {
    "stage": 0,
    "optional": [
      "runtime",
      "optimisation.modules.system",
      "es7.decorators"
    ]
  }
{% endhighlight %}

You don't even need to explicitly add the Babel regenerator like with other implementations, works out of the box! Credit to this [Gitter archive][gitter].
